iCelera eeg binary parser
=========================

Parse iCelera binary eeg output file to csv.

### Initiative

As long as iCelera does not provide any documentation about its binary output
file we decide to reverse engineer it.

### Why?

To use the output in various statistical methods and visualization platforms.

### References

I used some external references to decode and convert. The binary output file have some similarities to other eeg providers.
