iCelera eeg binary parser
=========================

Parse iCelera binary eeg output file to csv.

## Initiative

As long as iCelera does not provide any documentation about its binary output
file we decide to reverse engineer it.

### Why?

To use the output in different statistics methods and visualize in differente 
softwares.
